# The Gospel According to the BBB (Better Board Brigade): Why Your Swim Lanes Desperately Need a Catchy Makeover (You Poor Souls)

Friends, Romans, Countryfolk who still call their swim lanes "Doing" and "Done" (bless your cotton socks), lend me your ears! We, the enlightened members of the **Better Board Brigade (BBB)**, have come to deliver you from the tyranny of tedious terminology. For too long, your project boards have languished in a state of utter, soul-crushing normalcy. But fear not, for salvation is at hand!

We present to you the holy trinity of acronyms – **BRITEd**, **BRAVOS**, and **BRAINS** – the only logical next step in the evolution of project management (because, let's face it, everything else is just rearranging digital sticky notes).

**Why, you ask (with a hint of skepticism we can practically taste), should you abandon your perfectly adequate, albeit mind-numbingly boring, swim lane names? Let us illuminate the path to project enlightenment (and slightly less snooze-inducing meetings):**

**The Case for BRITEd: Because Progress Shouldn't Feel Like Watching Paint Dry**

Are your projects plodding along at the speed of a snail in molasses? Do your team members stare blankly at the board, a silent testament to the sheer lack of pizzazz? Then **BRITEd** is your beacon of hope!

- **B**acklog: Where dreams (and probably a few forgotten bugs) go to gestate. Still boring, but hey, we're working on it.
- **R**efined: Ah, the sweet smell of clarity! Tasks so well-groomed, they practically have their own LinkedIn profiles.
- **I**mpeded: The dramatic stage! Where progress goes to take a little "vacation" (usually involving finger-pointing and frantic Slack messages). At least now it has a fancy name!
- **T**ackling: Finally, some action! Watch with bated breath as your valiant team _tackles_ those refined (and hopefully un-impeded) tasks. So heroic!
- **E**valuating: The moment of truth! Will it pass? Will it fail spectacularly? Either way, it's being _evaluated_, which sounds much more sophisticated than just "testing," doesn't it?
- **D**elivered: The glorious end! Bask in the warm glow of accomplishment. You _delivered_ something! (Hopefully what was actually asked for).

**Embrace BRITEd and watch as your team's perception of progress… well, probably doesn't change much, but at least the board looks prettier!**

**The Case for BRAVOS: Because Your Project Deserves a Standing Ovation (Even if it Barely Works)**

Is your team a high-octane, adrenaline-fueled machine of productivity? (We're being generous here). Do you want your project board to exude an air of theatrical triumph? Then **BRAVOS** is your Oscar-worthy choice!

- **B**rainstorm: Where brilliant (and occasionally utterly bonkers) ideas are unleashed upon the world.
- **R**eady Set: The anticipation builds! Tasks are poised, ready to leap into action like Olympic sprinters (who occasionally trip at the starting line).
- **A**waiting: The dramatic pause! Suspense hangs in the air as tasks wait for that crucial dependency to be resolved (or for someone to remember they exist).
- **V**elocity: Feel the _speed_! Witness the flurry of activity as tasks zoom across the board (mostly to the "Blocked" column, but still!).
- **O**utcome: The grand reveal! The results are in! Did you nail it? Did you spectacularly miss the mark? Either way, it's an _outcome_!
- **S**uccess: Cue the confetti! The task is done! Take a bow! You are a champion! (Now, about those lingering bugs…)

**Choose BRAVOS and let your project board be a constant reminder that you are all stars… even if the final product is more of a student film.**

**The Case for BRAINS: Because Thinking is Hard, But at Least Your Board Can Look Smart**

Do you fancy yourselves a team of intellectual powerhouses? Do you enjoy the subtle superiority that comes with using slightly more sophisticated language? Then **BRAINS** is the Mensa-approved option for you!

- **B**acklog: The strategic reserve of intellectual challenges. Ponder them wisely.
- **R**eady for Action: These tasks have been deemed worthy of your brilliant minds. Proceed with utmost intellect.
- **A**waiting Unblock: A temporary intellectual impasse. Surely, your collective brainpower can overcome this minor setback.
- **I**n Motion: Witness the gears turning! Observe the synapses firing! Your team's cognitive prowess is on full display.
- **N**earing Completion: The culmination of intellectual effort is within reach. Almost there!
- **S**uccessfully Done: A testament to your team's superior intellect and flawless execution (we can dream, can't we?).

**Opt for BRAINS and let your project board subtly (or not so subtly) imply that your team is the smartest in the room. Even if you occasionally forget where you put your coffee.**

**In Conclusion (Before You Fall Asleep):**

Let's face it, renaming your swim lanes won't magically solve all your project woes. But it _will_ give you something slightly more interesting to talk about in your stand-ups. It will inject a tiny spark of amusement into the otherwise predictable march of tasks. And who knows, maybe, just maybe, it will make your project board a _tiny_ bit less depressing to look at.

So, join the **Better Board Brigade**! Cast off the shackles of humdrum terminology! Embrace the glorious absurdity of **BRITEd**, **BRAVOS**, or **BRAINS**! Your team (and your sanity) will thank you… probably. Now go forth and rename your lanes, you magnificent bastards! (We mean that in the most sarcastic and supportive way possible).
